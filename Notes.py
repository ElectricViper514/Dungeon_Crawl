'''These are my basic thoughts and notes for my first portfolio project.
I plan on designing a simple RPG dungeon crawl.
For simplicity sake, I will only have a single class and race. A human fighter.
Other races and classes may be implemented in at a later time.
The goal is to have a very basic combat system, item shop, and character advancement.
This is will be a short game.'''

'''The scope of the game is as follows:
The player will name their character, select gender, and select their starting stats based on
a stat pool that they can use to distribute to their characteristics.
The player can equip weapons and armor
Fight enemies
Run away
use potions to regain health
utilize a shop
Possibly even save their progress

The options will be menu driven allowing the player to select numbers and letters to interact
with the menus.

*** Characteristics ***
Strength = overall damage output and equipment weight that they can carry.
Constitution = overall hit points and resistance to damage.
Dexterity = gives a chance to dodge an attack.
Character level = increased through earning experience.
Experience = Earned from defeating monsters and completing tasks.
Gold = Who doesn't like some pocket change.

Synopsys: You were traveling and sought shelter in a nearby appearently abandonded castle.
You are greeted by the grounds keeper who offers you a meal.
You awaken in dungeon with only one option. To fight your way out in an attempt to
escape your prison.'''
