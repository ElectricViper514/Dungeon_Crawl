'''This is my first portfolio project from Codecademy. I am going to create a very simple text based
dungeon crawl where the player will be able to select their name. They will start with a small back
story and then they will be able to explore, encounter enemies, fight, flee, heal, and shop. There
will be a simple inventory management system.
A more detailed outline can be found within README.py'''
