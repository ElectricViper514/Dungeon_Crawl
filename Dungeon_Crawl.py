'''This is my first portfolio project from Codecademy. I am going to create a very simple text based
dungeon crawl where the player will be able to select their name. They will start with a small back
story and then they will be able to explore, encounter enemies, fight, flee, heal, and shop. There
will be a simple inventory management system.
A more detailed outline can be found within Notes.py'''

Welcome adventurer! Welcome to your final days. You have become the latest test subject of
the mad wizard Professor Bon Von Jovian  
      
You have awoken in a cold, dark room.
The only sound is that of the dripping of water in the distance.
As your vision clears and you shake the cobwebs from your head, you begin
to recall the events leading up to this point. You were at an office party when 
you started to feel ill. You remember someone claiming to be a doctor had offered
to help you. Your world faded to black after accepting her help.

You snap out of your thoughts as a very large rat scurries across the floor and over
your leg eliciting a small yelp from you.

investigate the pantry, you realize that you are only wearing some very basic

you find and old chef's knife. No sooner have you picked up the knife that you hear
the squeeking of an ROUS or Rodents of Unusual Size. In laymen's terms ... a giant rat!
      
Prepare to fight, because one of you two is on the menu for supper tonight.
And I don't think that you want it to be you that's on the dinner menu.
